<!--TODO: Add more patchnotes for basically every feature we do-->

<!--

WE DOING FULL STACK SHIT, BOOT UP THE C#

-->


<!-- 
    shit *I* did while *you* were away 13/17/2022;

    -   I keep getting sidetracked while working on this, there is now an ascii dungeon generator partially functioning, it's just making one room tho

    -   Changed it so that the applicationlist goes behind the taskbar, instead of above it, so that it never obscures it

    -   Realized we haven't actually made any 'plot' for out idler, added lore. Refer to the 'LOOOORE!' application.

    -   Sidetracked into clicking the button for about two minutes even though I haven't added any functionality (I was aware of this fact)

    -   Fixed an issue where the project was saved on my Desktop, since it's become much better than I thought it would. The 
        project is now stored in a more organised and definitely more permanent location.
    
    -   Added button "Add Storage" to the idler
    
    -   Added "Storage" resource to the idler

    -   Changed the footer so that it floats to the right, so that it won't fuck up my perception of the important parts as much

    shit i did while you were away 12/17/2022;

    - Fixed the startup buttons so that we dont have to press the text anymore, we just sorta arbitrarily added the
    function to the text when we could have added it to the list elements themselves, also removed mentions of the
    button class since that does nothing

    - Fixed the way the resizing works by doing some sp0o0o0ky and probably laggy javascript stuff, dont worry about it
    (specifically made it so that you can resize the window rapidly, just dont make the invisible overlay visible ever
    if you dont want to suffer from epilepsy)

    - Added Roguathia to the taskbar because why not

    - Moved all the taskbar buttons that open windows (except changelog) into a newly made start menu, 
    and made the start button open and close the start menu. Also added a transition to it because why the hell not, 
    we can change it if it doesn't fit though.

    - Made it so that every time you open a window a button representing that window is added to the bottom of the taskbar
    and clicking that button will minimize the window

    - Added a minimize button that does the same thing

    - Added a maximize button that toggles between setting the window to cover the entire desktop and setting its
    size back to what it was originally before maximizing

    <h2>December 15, 1997</h2>

    <h2>MessOS update v0.1.2: The <s>Pre-alpha</s> <s>Alpha</s> Beta "I fixed more stuff please stop leaving" Update!</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Reduced the errors per second count from 1 per window to 0 per window, ending the tyranny of what has been lovingly 
            referred to as the 'error incremental game';
        </li>

    <h2>MessOS update v0.1.1: The <s>Pre-alpha</s> <s>Alpha</s> Beta "I really should have fixed this before launch" Update!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Due to popular request, we added the ability to move the windows of any application you start up!;
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Hopefully fixed all of the system clock errors!;
        </li><br>
        <div class="devNote">
            This definitely isn't a lie and the way that the system clock interacts with the windows causing the generation of 
            an error per window per second is just an illusion that you should disregard;

        <li>
            Added beautiful and totally original desktop image!;

            Added Taskbar;

        <li>
            Added several applications to the taskbar: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    [Start] which links to a template page (do not question why the start button does this; 
                    just power off your pc when you are done instead);
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    [The Trashpile], that links to a page containing an image of an unfortunate victim of the Bunga virus 
                    that has had their head caved in, in such a manner as to resemble a wojak (Truly a fate worse than death);
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    And of course, a system clock!
