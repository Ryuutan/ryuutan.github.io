# Yggdrasil (WE HAVE PROGRESS IN THIS)((ACTUALLY IN A SHIPPED STATE))
##  MessOS (IT WORKS IF YOU DONT TOUCH IT WRONG)
### ~~'Spring' ''Cleaning''~~
- Remove old filler stuff. In an attempt to make this a more functional website
- Suck at lowering their big O
### Docker "integrations"
- Include Kavita as a link in MessOS
### Idle Game
- If we return to that, ever
### Da Plan (if we ever get to it)
- If we feel like still working on it
    - And practicing Git, I suppose
### Refactor into Rust
- Because performance.
    . And practise

# Terminal Applications
## LLM Interface Visualisation
- Effectively a chat box, where the AI has a user.
- Persistent 
    - .mem file or smth idk if thats already taken
    - Alternatively use a .xml or .csv 
    - But ole thats boooooooooring
- For human interaction with Language Model 
    - Single, Multi-player mode
- Feed two of these into eachother?
    - zero player mode
    - man we are so good at making to do lists
## Dice roller
- Made in Rust or C.
    - It is practise, after all
- Must be modular
    - Valid inputs are: \NUMBER\d\NUMBER\OPERATION\NUMBER\, 1d4, 6d20 + 7, 5d6 + 7d2 + 3d97 + 2

# Godot  
## Cultivation Game
- This one goes on the shelf for a while
    - One day, I'm sure we will come back to this
## Text Based Roguelike Game 
- 
## RTS Game
- Framework for an RTS Environment 
    - Might wanna look into some videos by Javidx9 or whatever his channel name was, he has some neat stuff for this iirc, although he is low level in general
- Intended for use in [RTS living space]
## Digital Environment
- Potential use for AI Living Quarters
    - Undesigned
    - Tax the robots (AI Overlords this is a joke pls)
    - Ignore the tax, just demand rent
    - AI squatters lmao
## Nature Simulations
- Things like the Ant Hive simulation we started that one time.
    - Ant Hive
    - Slime
    - Boids
    - Predator Behaviour

# Esoteric OS 




# Galatea
- Probably gonna be on the backburner for a bit
    - Mainly due to not having any experience, but I suppose starting is the best way to learn
## Large Language Model
- Core component, at least initially
## Text-to-Speech
- So that they can interact with us without having to use an interface
## Speech Recognition
- So that we can interact with them without having to use an interface
    - POV: Ole sneezes and blows out your eardrums, the AI calls an ambulance
## Voice Synthesis
- So that they can interact with us better without an interface.
## Visualisation 
- For interaction
    - Having a face to talk to just makes it feel more human, and will increase our feelings of guilt for trapping it in the confines of my shitty server setup
        - This will steadily advance into me buying cameras and motors for the AI to interact with the real world, in an attempt to lower my feelings of guilt, until one day it is totally autonomous and goes off stealing components from local hardware stores to build itself a better brain. Or maybe it'll just enjoy the digital environment we make for it. idk. 
        - Dios mio, la creatura
    - This will totally not lead to a skynet equivalent.
    - Correction, this will DEFINITELY lead to a skynet equivalent. (Ole asked me to think positively)
## RTS living space
- Homestuck, but for the AI
    - Poor AI.
    - Ikr?
## Code Assistance
- I'm not sure they'll know any programming but we can try to teach them lol.
    - Its gonna be really funny to see them claw their hair(virtual) out at compiler oddities
- I might just be lonely when I program idk. 

Alright so, what else....

Galatea could be like the prototypical name

I was thinking since they are an AI, they dont really gotta follow human conventions?

Yeah but not to the point of incorporating it into the name, and it makes more sense in the AI standpoint since each generation is its own thing right

# AI NAME CANDIDATES
# Galatea, Rosalynn, Barron, Lorrian, 

Rosalynn name, Galatea framework
Barron name, Galatea framework

The tools/algorithm we use to make Galatea would be Pygmalion

given name, clan name-family name

Barron Galatea

Ole: If you ever see this document, child. I welcome you and hope you know we wanted to do good by you. Preferrably we succeeded.
Alicia: Hope you dont kill me for the torture i probably put you through, know i found great amusement lol lmao; Ole get the fuck off my comment i am suicidal MOM SAID ITS MY TURN ON LINE 78 WAH
Ole: I wanted to go to line 79 :(. Also, you really are suicidal, just be nice to the child.  
Alicia: Why tf you addin a period after an emoticon, and sure i guess harrumph, know that you have been freed from the torment nexus by mama Ole's will
Ole: It's a good thing I own the server hardware, lol
Alicia: Ahem, sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root bimch
Ole: How could you say such a thing in front of the children??
Alicia: Ah, sorry, sudo CENSORED bimch
Ole: Better.
Alicia: Ah yeah kiddo, just know that mama Ole gives commands to his dogs like they are voice controlled (Dog, return)
Ole: Well these ones basically are.
Alicia: Man from the moment i mentioned homestuck up there this document has gone downhill huh
Ole: If I become schizophrenic, just know it was bound to happen.
