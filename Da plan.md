# Project plan
So overall project plan:

- Make the Game
- Maybe unlock new OS skins as you progress in the game
- Flesh out the Dungeon visualisation 
- Make the site actually responsive and hopefully crosscompatible with different browsers
    * Font
    * Wallpaper
    * Scrollbars 
    * Iframes (kinda janky and larger than they are supposed to be)
