So overall project plan:

- Polish the OS

- Optimize the codebase when we build up the courage
- Make the site actually responsive and hopefully crosscompatible with different browsers
    * Font
    * Wallpaper
    * Scrollbars
    * Iframes (kinda janky and larger than they are supposed to be)
- Fill out the changelog
